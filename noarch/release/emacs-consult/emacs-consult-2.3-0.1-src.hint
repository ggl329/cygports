sdesc: "Consulting completing-read for Emacs"
ldesc: "Consult provides search and navigation commands based on the Emacs completion function completing-read. Completion allows you to quickly select an item from a list of candidates. Consult offers asynchronous and interactive consult-grep and consult-ripgrep commands, and the line-based search command consult-line. Furthermore Consult provides an advanced buffer switching command consult-buffer to switch between buffers, recently opened files, bookmarks and buffer-like candidates from other sources. Some of the Consult commands are enhanced versions of built-in Emacs commands. For example the command consult-imenu presents a flat list of the Imenu with live preview, grouping and narrowing. Please take a look at the full list of commands."
