sdesc: "VERTical Interactive COmpletion for Emacs"
ldesc: "Vertico provides a performant and minimalistic vertical completion UI based on the default completion system. The focus of Vertico is to provide a UI which behaves correctly under all circumstances. By reusing the built-in facilities system, Vertico achieves full compatibility with built-in Emacs completion commands and completion tables. Vertico only provides the completion UI but aims to be highly flexible, extendable and modular. Additional enhancements are available as extensions or complementary packages. The code base is small and maintainable. The main vertico.el package is only about 600 lines of code without white space and comments."
