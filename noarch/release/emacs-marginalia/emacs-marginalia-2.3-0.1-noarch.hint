ldesc: "This package provides marginalia-mode which adds marginalia to the minibuffer completions. Marginalia are marks or annotations placed at the margin of the page of a book or in this case helpful colorful annotations placed at the margin of the minibuffer for your completion candidates. Marginalia can only add annotations to the completion candidates. It cannot modify the appearance of the candidates themselves, which are shown unaltered as supplied by the original command."
