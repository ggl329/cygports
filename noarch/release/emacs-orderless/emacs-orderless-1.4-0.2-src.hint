sdesc: "Emacs completion style that matches multiple regexps in any order"
ldesc: "This package provides an orderless completion style that divides the pattern into space-separated components, and matches candidates that match all of the components in any order. Each component can match in any one of several ways: literally, as a regexp, as an initialism, in the flex style, or as multiple word prefixes. By default, regexp and literal matches are enabled."
