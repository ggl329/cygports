# cygports

Cygwin ports for my use.

## Install

You can install packages with setup-x86_64. URI for this cygports is 'https://ggl329.github.io/cygports'.
Specify the URI on GUI installation or as command line option in addition to your using cygwin mirror site.
A command line option "--no-verify" (or "-X") is also necessary, because setup.ini is not signed.

    setup-x86_64.exe --no-verify --site=https://ggl329.github.io/cygports --site=<your using cygwin mirror site>
